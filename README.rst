Introduction
============

This repository contains the interactive textbook designed for the upper-level
UC Davis engineering course on Mechanical Vibrations (ENG 122). The textbook is
designed with these ideas in mind:

- That students can learn about mechanical vibrations engineering through
  "computational thinking", i.e. actively interacting with a computer and
  writing code to simulate and analyze computational models and experimental
  data.
- That the computer allows students to solve vibration engineering problems
  without knowing all of the mathematical theory apriori. This means that we
  can motivate students to dig deeper into the theory and by presenting it
  posteriori when the motivation is high.
- Students learn best by doing. The content is meant to used in class while the
  instructors act as a coach through the learning.
- Open access materials promote easy reuse, remixing, and dissemination.

Learning Objectives
===================

After completing the course, students will be able to:

- model a physical vibrating system and understand it's essential motion characteristics
- numerically integrate non-linear systems
- understand how the eigenvalue problem can model a vibrational system
- design a mechanical system with vibration in mind
- measure vibrations and interpret the meaning of the data
- to analyze a vibrational system using computation

Outline
=======

The course is taught over 20 two hour class periods during a quarter system of
10 weeks of instructions and 1 week for examinations. One of the 20 class
periods is reserved for a midterm examination, 2 hours are reserved for exam
reviews leaving 18 main topics. The following lists the topics for each of the
class periods:

1. Intro to vibrations: do a complete example with minimal overhead
2. Free harmonic motion with and without viscous damping
3. Forced harmonic motion with and without viscous damping
4. Modeling physical systems
5. Lagrange’s method (conservative and nonconservative forces)
6. Estimating system parameters from vibrations (live experiment where we give them data)
7. Non-linear vibration (Coulomb) + simulation of non-linear systems
8. Impulse response (heaviside)
9. Stability: book balance
10. Base excitation: car on bumpy road
11. Mass imbalance
12. Arbitrary forcing (convolution integral)
13. Arbitrary periodic forcing (fourier series)
14. Modal analysis of decomposable systems: building
15. Modal analysis of non-decomposable: bicycle modeshapes
16. Isolator design
17. Vibration absorbers

Other:

- Stiffness
- Equivalency in stiffness, damping, mass, etc
- Free response to two dof
- Transform methods
- Response random inputs
- Analgoy to electrica circuits or other energy domains
- More indepth non-linear vibratory systems
- Relationship to FEA of structures
- Beams and membranes: continous systems (euler’s beam equation)
