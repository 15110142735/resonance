Resonance: Learning Mechanical Vibration Engineering Through Computation
========================================================================

**NOTE : This material is very much in draft form. Comments welcome in the
issues.**

Introduction
============

This repository contains the interactive learning materials designed for the
upper-level UC Davis engineering course on Mechanical Vibrations (ENG 122). The
textbook is designed with these ideas in mind:

- That students can learn about mechanical vibrations engineering through
  "computational thinking", i.e. actively interacting with a computer and
  writing code to simulate and analyze computational models and experimental
  data.
- That the computer allows students to solve vibration engineering problems
  without knowing all of the mathematical theory a priori. This means that we
  can motivate students to dig deeper into the theory and by presenting it
  posteriori when the motivation is high.
- Students learn best by doing. The content is meant to used in class while the
  instructors act as a coach through the learning.
- Open access materials promote easy reuse, remixing, and dissemination.

Learning Objectives
===================

There are three broad learning objectives that we focus on in the course:

1. Students will be able to analyze vibrational measurement data to draw
   conclusions about the measured system's vibrationnal nature and describe how
   the systems behaves vibrationally.
2. Students will be able to create simple mathematical and computational models
   of real vibrating systems that can be used to answer specific questions
   about the system by consisely demonstrating the vibrational phenomena.
3. Students will be able to design a mechanical structure that has desireable
   vibrational behavior.

Students that master these three core learning objectives will be well prepared
to use mechanical vibration concepts, theories, and tools to solve engineering
problems.

For a more detailed topical outline with specific per-activity learning
objectives see the `outline <outline.rst>`_.

Assessment
==========

The students will be assessed through a series of in- and out-of- class
exercises that focus on individual lesson topics, two examinations, and on an
individual open-ended vibration design project.

Methodology
===========

There are a few principles to teaching:

1. We want to maximize the student "doing" both in-class and out.
2. Computational objects will be used to represent real vibrational systems and
   the students will interact with these objects to discover vibrational
   concepts as a first step.
