Learning Objectives
===================

There are three broad learning objectives that we focus on in the course:

1. Students will be able to analyze vibrational measurement data to draw
   conclusions about the measured system's vibrationnal nature and describe how
   the systems behaves vibrationally.
2. Students will be able to create simple mathematical and computational models
   of real vibrating systems that can be used to answer specific questions
   about the system by consisely demonstrating the vibrational phenomena.
3. Students will be able to design a mechanical structure that has desireable
   vibrational behavior.

Students that master these three core learning objectives will be well prepared
to use mechanical vibration concepts, theories, and tools to solve engineering
problems.

Assessment
==========

The students will be assessed through a series of in- and out-of- class
exercises that focus on individual lesson topics, two examinations, and on an
individual open-ended vibration design project.

Methodology
===========

There are a few principles to teaching:

1. We want to maximize the student "doing" both in-class and out.
2. Computational objects will be used to represent real vibrational systems and
   the students will interact with these objects to discover vibrational
   concepts as a first step.

Topical Outline
===============

The course is designed around 18 two hour in-class learning sessions, 2 two
hour exams, spread over an 11 week quarter. The class is divided into three
broad topics based on the three primary learning objectives.

Analyzing Vibrating Systems
---------------------------

After finishing this section students will be able to:

- Describe different methods of measuring vibrations
- Choose appropriate sensors and a placement
- excite a system with different input signals
- visualize the vibrational measurements
- use time domain techniques to characterize a system's behavior
- use frequency domain techniques to characterize a system's behavior

Modeling Vibrating Systems
--------------------------

After finishing this section students will be able to:

- identify the essential aspects to model (# degrees of freedom, coordinates,
  modeling assumptions)
- draw a vibration free body diagram of a real system
- write the non-linear equations of motion of a vibrating system
- write a linear equation of motion for a vibrating system
- transform a mathematical model into a computational model
- validate that the model behaves like the real system in a way that is optimal
  for answering your questions about the system

Designing Vibrating Systems
---------------------------

After finishing this section students will be able to:

- realize that mass, stiffness, damping, and geometry affect behavior in a
  complex coupled way.  Understand the tradeoffs among adjusting model
  parameters
- use common methods like isolators, mass balance, mass abosrber to control
  behavior
